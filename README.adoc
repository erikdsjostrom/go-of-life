= Game of life in GO

Nothing fancy, just a simple implementation that I built
because I wanted to play around in go. It simulates the
game of life on a torus (meaning the edges wrap around)
and supports the following mechanics:

* Space to pause
* Enter to un-pause
* Using the mouse to add new cells, single click or click and drag

That's it, if decide to test it out remember to make your terminal text smaller
so the whole board can be shown.

[Caution]
====
The board size is
hard coded to 100x100 cells so if you try to click outside
of this invisible boundary it will crash.
